# West Point IS450 2007

Assorted PHP scripts used in my Distributed Application Engineering course at West Point in 2007. This was focused on the LAMP stack.

This includes PHP code associated with my final project, a web app used to manage the checkout process of military equipment, such as rifles, night vision goggles, body armor, etc.
